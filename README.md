## Sma5hMusic GUI - What is it?
Sma5h.CLI and Sma5hMusic are a series of tools to import additional tracks to Smash Ultimate.
This tool is highly experimental and may not always work as expected.
* For detailed setup steps: https://github.com/Deinonychus71/Sma5hMusic/wiki
* **Always keep backups of your files and savegames.**
* **This mod is not safe online!**
* Suggestions are welcome. Please create an issue for it.

## How to create an issue - bug ##
* Please do not create an issue if you're having trouble with the setup. I will not provide the resource files as this would be piracy. You need to extract them yourself from your own backup.
* Please check the wiki for troubleshooting, it may contain an answer to your question already. I will try to keep it updated.
* At the very least you should make sure you are using latest with unmodified files and no other mods enabled as first troubleshooting steps.
* I have limited time so issues such as 'it's not working please help' will be ignored / closed. 
* Please provide the following :
- Version detected by the program (should be software latest and game latest)
- Provide a sample of the log where the issue is found or a screenshot
- Provide reproducible steps. (such as "I launched the software, did this, clicked there, and then this happened")
- If relevant please provide the metadata_mod.json files or override json files (from /Mods) that you think might have an issue. If you're having issues to start the program you can link the appsettings.json (Root folder) file too.
