## Sma5hMusic GUI - What is it?
Sma5h.CLI and Sma5hMusic are a series of tools to import additional tracks to Smash Ultimate.
This tool is highly experimental and may not always work as expected.
* For detailed setup steps: https://github.com/Deinonychus71/Sma5hMusic/wiki
* **Always keep backups of your files and savegames.**
* **This mod is not safe online!**
* Suggestions are welcome. Please create an issue for it.
* For bugs please provide reproducible steps. Issues that are not well detailed might be ignored/closed.
